    <h1>Built from real study notes</h1>
    <p class="lede">
      I built AWS Exam Prep while studying for AWS certifications. I’m a heavy note‑taker, and I wanted a faster
      way to rehearse architecture decisions and terminology. This site turns those notes into quick drills and
      flashcards so others can benefit too.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      Personal goal: complete all 13 AWS certifications. I already hold 7 and am renewing some while working toward
      the remaining ones.
