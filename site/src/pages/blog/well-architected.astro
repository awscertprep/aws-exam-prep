    <h1>AWS Well-Architected Framework — 10-Minute Interview Version</h1>
    <p class="lede">
      A fast, interview-ready walkthrough that focuses on pillars, trade-offs, and how teams apply the
      framework in practice.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="surface">
    <h2>1. What it is (30-45 seconds)</h2>
    <p>
      "The AWS Well-Architected Framework is a decision-making framework used to design, review, and
      continuously improve cloud workloads. It’s not an audit or checklist — it’s a structured way to
      identify architectural risks and make informed trade-offs across six pillars."
    </p>
    <p class="muted">Key phrases interviewers expect: workload-level, trade-offs, continuous improvement, not an audit.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="surface">
    <h2>2. Why it exists (30 seconds)</h2>
    <p>
      "Cloud removes many traditional constraints, but it introduces new failure modes: misconfiguration,
      scaling issues, security gaps, and cost waste. The framework captures AWS’s experience running
      internet-scale systems and helps teams avoid repeating common mistakes."
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="surface">
    <h2>3. The six pillars (2 minutes total)</h2>

    <h3>Operational Excellence</h3>
    <p>Question it answers: Can we run and improve this system safely over time?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Observability (metrics, logs, traces tied to business KPIs)</li>
      <li>Automation (infra and ops as code)</li>
      <li>Small, reversible changes</li>
      <li>Post-incident learning</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">Typical services: CloudWatch, X-Ray, CloudTrail, Systems Manager, CloudFormation</p>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>Question: Is everything protected by design, not by trust?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Least privilege</li>
      <li>No long-term credentials</li>
      <li>Defense in depth</li>
      <li>Encrypt everywhere</li>
      <li>Prepare for incidents</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">Non-negotiable points: Humans -> IAM Identity Center + MFA; machines -> IAM roles + temporary credentials</p>

    <h3>Reliability</h3>
    <p>Question: Will it work when needed — and recover when it fails?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Failure is expected</li>
      <li>Multi-AZ by default</li>
      <li>Automated recovery</li>
      <li>Decoupling</li>
      <li>Backups + DR aligned to RTO/RPO</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">Typical services: ALB, Auto Scaling, RDS Multi-AZ, DynamoDB, Route 53</p>

    <h3>Performance Efficiency</h3>
    <p>Question: Are we using the right resources efficiently?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose the right compute model</li>
      <li>Prefer managed services</li>
      <li>Cache aggressively</li>
      <li>Re-evaluate continuously as demand and tech change</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">Typical services: Lambda, ECS/EKS, CloudFront, ElastiCache, Compute Optimizer</p>

    <h3>Cost Optimization</h3>
    <p>Question: Are we paying only for business value?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Measure unit cost</li>
      <li>Eliminate idle resources</li>
      <li>Use the right pricing model</li>
      <li>Cost is a design constraint</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">Typical services: Cost Explorer, Budgets, Savings Plans, Trusted Advisor</p>

    <h3>Sustainability</h3>
    <p>Question: Are we minimizing environmental impact?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Right-size resources</li>
      <li>Align supply with demand</li>
      <li>Reduce data movement</li>
      <li>Prefer managed and serverless services</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">Important insight: This pillar strongly overlaps with cost optimization.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="surface">
    <h2>4. Trade-offs (1 minute)</h2>
    <p>
      "Trade-offs are expected. You might optimize cost in dev and test and reliability in production.
      However, security and operational excellence are generally not trade-offs — weakening them
      increases systemic risk."
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="surface">
    <h2>5. Cloud-native design principles (1 minute)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Stop guessing capacity -> elastic scaling</li>
      <li>Test at production scale -> temporary environments</li>
      <li>Automate everything -> infra and ops as code</li>
      <li>Design for evolution -> expect change</li>
      <li>Use data -> metrics over opinions</li>
      <li>Practice failure -> game days</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="surface">
    <h2>6. The review process (45 seconds)</h2>
    <p>
      "The framework is applied through Well-Architected Reviews using the AWS Well-Architected Tool.
      Reviews happen throughout the lifecycle, not just before go-live. Risks are identified,
      prioritized, and remediated over time."
    </p>
    <p class="muted">Key phrase: continuous review, not one-time certification.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="surface">
    <h2>7. How architects actually use it (1 minute)</h2>
    <p>
      "In real teams, the framework provides a common language for architects, security, operations,
      and leadership. It helps justify design decisions, explain trade-offs, and prioritize improvements
      using data instead of opinion."
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="surface">
    <h2>8. One-sentence closing</h2>
    <p>
      "The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps architects design systems that are secure, reliable,
      efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable — and, most importantly, able to evolve safely over
      time."
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="surface">
    <h2>How to use this in interviews</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Answer in pillars, not services.</li>
      <li>Explain why, not just what.</li>
      <li>Always mention trade-offs.</li>
      <li>Tie technical choices to business outcomes.</li>
    </ul>
